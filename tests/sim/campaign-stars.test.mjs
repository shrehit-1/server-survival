// The third star, and whether any play can reach it (#256).
//
// The formula was covered and correct; what nothing covered was whether a
// real level could satisfy it. A level ends the instant its primaries all
// pass, so on the eleven levels whose primary is `survive_Ns` the earliest
// possible win is exactly N — and the third star wanted 0.8N. `N <= 0.8N` is
// false for every positive N, so those levels capped at two stars however
// perfectly they were played, and cache_master, replica_master, search_master
// and completionist went with them.
//
// Two kinds of check live here, and they answer different questions:
//   1. The WALK is arithmetic. It asks, for every shipped level, whether any
//      path to the third star is structurally open. It is the regression
//      guard: the next `survive_*` primary re-closes this silently otherwise.
//   2. The PROOFS are simulation. They play the three levels that gate an
//      achievement through the real path and land three stars. Arithmetic
//      cannot tell you a bonus pair is reachable; only a run can.
