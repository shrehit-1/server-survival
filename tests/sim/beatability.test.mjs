// Is the lesson load-bearing? (#254)
//
// The repo already proves levels are WINNABLE. What it has never checked is
// the other half of the #184 discipline: that a level is LOST when its own
// mechanic is ignored. A level that passes without the thing it teaches is not
// a lesson, it is a cutscene with a timer.
//
// Measuring that across chapter 2 turned up something the issue did not
// predict. Two levers are available on every one of these levels: the service
// the briefing teaches, and the $100 Compute tier (capacity 4 -> 10) that every
// budget here can afford. Removing them one at a time says which one the level
// actually turns on (five seeds, with the levels' own burst patterns firing):
//
//   level  teaches   taught+tier  tier only  taught only  neither
//   L3     CDN         5/5          0/5        5/5         0/5
//   L4     Cache       5/5          5/5        2/5         2/5
//   L5     Queue       5/5          0/5        0/5         0/5
//   L6     Replica     5/5          5/5        0/5         0/5
//   L7     Search      5/5          5/5        0/5         0/5
//   L8     NoSQL       5/5          5/5        0/5         0/5
//   L9     API GW      0/5          0/5        0/5         0/5
//   L12    2nd WAF     5/5          0/5        0/5         0/5
//
// L4 still passes on an untouched board. On three more (6, 7, 8) the taught
// node is decorative in BOTH directions: without the tier they lose even when
// it is correctly wired, and with the tier they win without it. The cause is
// capacity — Compute runs 4 concurrent at 600ms, about 6.7 req/s, and those
// levels arrive at 6-7 rps — so Compute binds before any downstream store can
// matter. For those four, chapter 2 mechanically teaches "buy a bigger box".
//
// L3, L5 and L12 are what a working lesson looks like: withhold the CDN, the
// queue or the second WAF and the level is lost, whatever else is bought.
// Neither a spike nor a malicious share is something more CPU absorbs.
//
// L3 is the strongest shape of the three, and the only one where the taught
// node is not merely necessary but SUFFICIENT: the CDN alone wins 5/5 while
// the Compute tier alone, a DB tier, auto-scaling, and tier-plus-auto-scaling
// each lose 5/5. It got there by making its own briefing true — "your site
// went viral" is a spike, and it did not have one.
//
// L9 is broken rather than hollow — no legal build wins it at all (#276).
//
// An earlier revision of this file recorded L5 as hollow and L9 as winnable.
// Both were wrong for the same reason: `burstPattern` schedules its spawns on
// real setTimeout, the harness ran a synchronous loop, and all five burst
// levels were measured as if they had no bursts. campaign-play.mjs now
// advances timers per frame, calibrated on L21.
//
// This file does not retune anything. Retuning shipped levels moves the
// difficulty of a campaign people have already played, and that is a decision
// to take deliberately. What it does is pin the table above so the hollow set
// can only ever SHRINK, and prove the reference solutions still win.
