/**
 * One frame of animate()'s sim-relevant work, in animate()'s order.
 *
 * The timer advance is not decoration. A level's `burstPattern` schedules its
 * spawns on real `setTimeout` (campaign.js stagggers them 20ms apart), so a
 * synchronous loop never sees a single burst: five of the shipped levels
 * declare one and all five played as if they had none. At timeScale 1 the game
 * advances one second of game time per second of wall clock, so advancing fake
 * timers by dt*1000 is exactly what the browser does. Calibrated on L21, whose
 * reference solution wins 3/3 both with timers and without.
 *
 * STATE.timeScale is forced to 1 on every call for the same reason: play()
 * calls startCampaignLevel() before this loop starts, and startCampaignLevel
 * runs resetGame(), which parks timeScale at 0 (paused) exactly like a real
 * run before the player presses Play. Most systems never notice a stuck
 * pause — they only ever see the dt they are handed, and every dt here is
 * non-zero regardless of timeScale. But circuit-breaker recovery,
 * autoscaling, metrics and hints all gate explicitly on
 * `STATE.timeScale === 0`, so without this they would freeze forever mid-run
 * instead of recovering the way an unpaused run does. Setting it here rather
 * than once in play() means any future caller that drives frame() directly
 * inherits the fix instead of needing to know about it.
